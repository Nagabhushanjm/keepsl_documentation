<li>What is it? -> It's a summary at a Trading Account Level. Meaning, it includes all positions that may or may not be owned by KEEPSL algo.</li>



<li><p id:p> Why? ->  In the event SL is missed or not placed, OR position EXIT failed for some reason, the user may not be aware, and the position may go on for several days which could result in huge losses. This way, you know if such a scenario exists in your trading accounts.
